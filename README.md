CS 300 Portfolio Reflection — ABCU Advising Program

Developed and analyzed solutions for the ABCU Advising Assistance Program, which required loading course data, organizing it efficiently, printing courses in alphanumeric order, and searching for individual courses with prerequisites.

Approached the problem by defining a clear Course data structure and comparing vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to understand how data structures impact runtime, memory usage, and scalability.

Applied Big-O analysis in Project One to evaluate insertion, searching, and printing performance, which guided the decision to use a Binary Search Tree for implementation.

Implemented a custom Binary Search Tree in C++ in Project Two, using in-order traversal to automatically maintain and print courses in sorted order while supporting efficient course lookup.

Overcame challenges related to file parsing, formatting, and validation by creating helper functions for trimming whitespace, normalizing input, handling malformed data, and validating menu input.

Expanded my software design approach by focusing on efficiency and scalability rather than just functionality, learning to choose data structures intentionally based on program requirements.

Improved code maintainability and readability by organizing logic into modular functions, using clear naming conventions, and designing adaptable code that can be extended without major rewrites.
